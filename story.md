In the world of MiniCode Compiler, three data-structure heroes work together to fix student programs.
Whenever a student types code, Queue Tabshair collects each line one by one and sends them to the system.
Next, Linked List Aziz stores the tokens in a clean sequence so they stay connected in the correct order.
Then Stack Hassaan helps the system check matching brackets, parentheses, and nested structures.
If there is a missing bracket or wrong nesting, Stack Hassaan immediately finds the error.
Arrays are used in the background to store keywords, operators, and error messages.
Together, these structures form a mini compiler that can detect basic syntax mistakes.
With every program they check, the MiniCode world becomes cleaner and error-free.
